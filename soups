**green lentil soup with coconut milk & warm spices**

The key to this soup is to use butter. Also, add a handful of chopped spinach  to the pot a few minutes before serving.

3 T unsalted butter
1 large yellow onion, finely chopped
2 large garlic cloves, finely chopped
1 large stalk celery, finely diced
1 t herbes de provence
1 T curry paste or powder
1/2 t ground cardamom
1/2 t ground cinnamon
1/4 t ground cloves
A pinch of nutmeg
1 Â½ c green lentils, rinsed & picked over
5 c vegetable stock
A few grinds of black pepper
1 13oz can coconut milk
kosher salt, to taste
slices of lemon or yogurt or cooked brown rice for serving

Melt the butter in a large stock pot over medium heat, adding in the onions, celery and garlic, stirring once in a while until soft, lightly brown and fragrant. Add in a pinch of kosher salt along with the herbs de provence, the curry powder or paste, and the rest of the spices. Stir in the lentils and pour in the vegetable stock. Simmer until the lentils are tender, about 30 minutes. Add in the coconut milk and a good grind of fresh black pepper, stir and simmer for another 15 minutes to blend the flavours. Taste and add additional salt or pepper if needed. Serve in large bowls with a squeeze of lemon or spoonful or yogurt, if warranted. Personally, I just ate the soup over a scoop of brown rice. It worked out deliciously.
